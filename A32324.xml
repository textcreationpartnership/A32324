            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He unwarrantable Proceedings of the laſt Houſe of Commons, were the Occaſion of My parting with the laſt Parliament. For I, who will never uſe Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment My Self, am reſolved not to ſuffer it in others. I am unwilling to mention Particulars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am deſirous to forget Faults: But who-ever ſhall calmly conſider what Offers I have formerly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103908:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->made, and what Aſſurances I renewed to the laſt Parliament, how I recommended nothing ſo much to them, as the Alliance I had made for Preſervation of the general Peace in Chriſtendom, and the further Examination of the Popiſh Plot, and how I deſired their Advice and Aſſiſtance concerning the Preſervation of <hi>Tangi<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r;</hi> and ſhall then reflect upon the ſtrange unſuitable Returns made to ſuch Propoſitions; by Men that were call'd together to Conſult, perhaps may wonder more, that I had patience ſo long, than that at laſt I grew weary of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>I have thought it neceſſary to ſay thus much to you, That I may not have any new Occaſion given Me to remember more of the late Miſcarriages. It is as much My Intereſt, and ſhall be as much My Care as yours, to preſerve the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe the Crown can never be ſafe when that is in danger. And I would have you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be convinc'd, that neither your Liberties nor Properties can ſubſiſt long, when the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown are invaded, or the Honour of the Government brought low, and into Diſreputation.</p>
            <p>I let you ſee by My calling this Parliament ſo ſoon, that no Irregularities in Parliaments ſhall make Me out of Love with them; and by this Means offer you another Opportunity of providing for Our Security here, by giving that Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Protection to Our Neighbours and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which you cannot but know they expect from Us, and extremely ſtand in need of at this inſtant; and at the ſame time give one Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more, that I have not neglected My part, to give that general Satisfaction and Security,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103908:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->
which, by the Bleſſing of God, may be attained, if you, on your parts, bring ſuitable Diſpoſitions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: And that the juſt Care you ought to have of Religion, be not ſo managed and improv'd into unneceſſary Fears, as to be made a pretence for changing the Foundations of the Government.</p>
            <p>I hope the Example of the ill Succeſs of former Heats, will diſpoſe you to a better Temper, and not ſo much to Inveigh againſt what is paſt, as to Conſider what is beſt to be done in the preſent Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>The further Proſecution of the Plot, the Tryal of the Lords in the Tower, the Providing a more ſpeedy Conviction for Recuſants; and, if it be practicable, the Ridding Our ſelves quite of all of that Party, that have any conſiderable Authority and Intereſt amongſt Them, are Things, though of the higheſt Importance, that hardly need to be recommended to you, they are ſo obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's Conſideration, and ſo neceſſary for Our Security. But I muſt needs deſire you not to lay ſo much weight upon any one Expedient againſt Popery, as to determine, that all other are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: And among all Your Cares for Religion, remember, that without the Safety and Dignity of the Monarchy, neither Religion nor Property can be preſerved.</p>
            <p>What I have formerly, and ſo often declared touching the Succeſſion, I cannot depart from. But to remove all reaſonable Fears that may ariſe from the Poſſibility of a Popiſh Succeſſor's coming to the Crown, if means can be found, that, in ſuch a Caſe, the Adminiſtration of the Government may remain in Proteſtant Hands; I ſhall be ready to hearken to any ſuch Expedient, by which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103908:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->
might be preſerv'd, and the Monarchy not deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore earneſtly recommend to you, to provide for the Religion and the Government to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with regard to one another, becauſe they ſupport each other: And let Us be united at home, that We may recover the Eſteem and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion We uſed to have abroad.</p>
            <p>I conclude with this One Advice to you, That the Rules and Meaſures of all your Votes may be the known and eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land, which neither can, nor ought to be departed from, nor chang'd, but by Act of Parliament: And I may tho more reaſonably require, That you make the Laws of the Land your Rule, becauſe I am reſolved they ſhall be Mine.</p>
